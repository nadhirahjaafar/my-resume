<p><font color="black"><li><strong>As criteria to graduate for my diploma, I have been expereience as being a school teacher and I learn a lot of new things when become a teacher such as I know how to support instructional activities, learner engagement, classroom management and behaviour modification. I also follow school policies and teacher guidelines to ensure my student safety and achievement of learning outcomes by using KSSR in my teaching syllabus. I also able to conduct classroom activity with my students which is Year 6 based on differentiated learning needs to ensure all students are learning at full potential.Besides that, i'm also able to be flexible where learned to be creative and active, and as the practicum teacher I need to manage a lot of things such as relief a lot of classes in a day and help to manage a lot of programs in the school.  
</li></strong></p>

<br/><br/>


<p><font color="black"><li><strong>When I'm graduate as English teacher, I had tried to find a job as a teacher while i'm waiting to further my studies. So, I have been working as personal tutor for 7 months. I got a different experience when i'm was being a personal tutor where at first I thought it's also difficult as being a school teacher but for me when I be a personal tutor I felt easy to conduct my own class with my student. It is because only me and only one student so it's really easy for me to focus to him while i'm was teaching.However, it's has disadvantage when i'm was teaching him alone because he will gets boring and sleepy because I cannot teach him like i'm was teaching in school where I can conduct my class with a lot of group activities, but I can handle him with my own way to get him for being exciting in my lesson. 
</li></strong></p>

<br/><br/>

<p><font color="black"><li><strong>Besides that, I also have been experience in teaching as tuition teacher for 4 months. This is my first new expereince become a tuition teacher, and I gets a huge different experience when i'm was teaching a tuition center.In tuition center, it's different from a school because in school the students have been seperated according to the proficieny level by class but in tuition center all students are joined together in one class. So, I as a teacher I need to identify the slow learner so that they didn't miss out while i'm was teaching in the class.
